        "about": "於二零一一年四月成立，並於同年九月於香港正式註冊為非牟利劇團，致力於文字及戲劇創作。\n \n劇團堅持以文本出發，尋求新思維新路向。我們相信劇場與社會息息相關，希望能透過戲劇提出對社會的質疑與探索，令創作者以致觀眾對現況產生提問，反思當下。\n\nEstablished by Miss Cathy Lam (former company manger of Theater Horizon) in April 2011. Which focus on text-based theater, admires the beauty of text and respect any kind of text. \n \nWe believe that theater and society are closely related. We hunger and seek for the new thinking through different approach of text, we question and explore the present world through the play, we hope and search the way to a be a better man through the reflection between theater and the audience. \n \nWe know this road is long and tough, but it is also fascinating to keep us moving on."
