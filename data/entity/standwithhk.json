        "about": "Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\n\nWe are a completely independent, grassroots, crowdfunded group of individuals who have come together to fight for what was promised to us as Hongkongers. We come from all walks of life and range widely in age and profession, united in our love for our home.\n\nIn the last 22 years, we have witnessed China's erosion of our fundamental freedoms, human rights and rule of law. China's conduct has been in breach of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration — a legally binding treaty — which also forms the basis of the 1992 US Hong Kong Policy Act. Shocked and heartbroken at the recent events in Hong Kong and the local government’s intransigence, we organised public fundraisers to call on the international community to stand with Hongkongers in our fight for freedom.\n\nVisit our website standwithhk.org and our social media channels to stay in touch!"
