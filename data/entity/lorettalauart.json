        "about": "Wai Ting Loretta Lau was born and raised in Hong Kong. In 2018, she moved to Prague to engage in advanced study in intermedia studio in UMPRUM, works on intermedia, performance and contemporary painting. In the meanwhile, Hong Kong people are losing their welfare, freedom of speech and personal safety rapidly. This influenced her first performance on 4th June 2019 entitled “Letter to my people” in DOX – Centre For Contemporary Art, which payed tribute to Liu Xiao- bo, the only Chinese Nobel Peace Prize winner, and to the deceased students who sacrificed their life for the brighter future of humanity. The executor shaved her hair as a symbol of impending prison sentence. On 10th October, 2019 she presented a public art performance – ‘Memory Eraser’ in the National Theatre in Prague. Her works are searching the boundaries between political and personal identities, which are now exhibiting throughout Europe and being collected by auction house Fabiani Arte in Italy."
