        "about": "Ricker Choi has a successful career in financial risk management but his first love is classical music — a passion he discovered at age 12 when he was still living in Hong Kong.  Ricker began studying piano at age 13, after his family immigrated to Canada.  Through years of dedicated practice he earned the ARCT Diploma in Piano Performance at age 18.  Faced with a choice between a career in music and in business, Ricker opted for the “easy route” and enrolled in York University’s Schulich School of Business, where he earned an undergraduate degree and MBA. \n\nIn 2006 Ricker combined his love of piano and philanthropy to establish Music Heals!, a series of fund-raising concerts for charity organizations such as SickKids Foundation.
